# Calculator
## Calculator application built in Javascript

This project implements a calculator application built in Javascript following a MVC Design Pattern.
The project is divided into:
- View: it handles the front-end of the project, what the user effectively sees when using the application.
- Logic: it handles the calculator logic.
- Controller: it works as intermediary between view and logic. It receveis and assesses the user inputs and consequentially updates the view.
